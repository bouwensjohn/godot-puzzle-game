# Second Challenge Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a second challenge that activates after completing the first puzzle. The second challenge includes a wall obstacle that requires collision detection and bouncing physics.

## Key Features

### 1. Challenge Progression
- **First Challenge**: Basic puzzle (move piece to slot)
- **Completion**: Triumph sound plays + 3-second delay
- **Second Challenge**: Same puzzle but with wall obstacle

### 2. Wall Obstacle
- **Size**: Rectangular wall, approximately half screen height (H * 0.5)
- **Width**: 20 pixels
- **Position**: Centered between piece and slot (W * 0.5, H * 0.35)
- **Color**: Brown (0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 1.0)

### 3. Collision Detection
- **Method**: AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection
- **Ship Radius**: 30 pixels approximate collision boundary
- **Bounce Physics**: Velocity reversal with 0.8 energy loss factor
- **Anti-Sticking**: Automatic push-away mechanism to prevent wall clipping

### 4. Audio Enhancement
- **Triumph Sound**: C5-E5-G5 major chord progression
- **Duration**: 1.5 seconds with vibrato and envelope
- **Timing**: Plays immediately when first challenge completes

### 5. Game Flow
```
Splash Screen (1s) → 
First Challenge → 
[Piece reaches slot] → 
Triumph Sound + 3s Delay → 
Second Challenge (with wall)
```

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Rotate and thrust forklift
- **Spacebar**: Grab/release piece
- **R Key**: Reset current challenge

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created:
1. `scenes/ChallengeTwo.tscn` - Second challenge scene
2. `scripts/challenge_two.gd` - Wall collision logic
3. `scripts/game_manager.gd` - Challenge progression system
4. `scripts/audio_manager.gd` - Triumph sound generation
5. `scripts/main.gd` - Challenge completion signaling

### Collision Algorithm:
```gdscript
# AABB collision detection
if (ship_pos.x + ship_radius > wall_left and 
    ship_pos.x - ship_radius < wall_right and
    ship_pos.y + ship_radius > wall_top and
    ship_pos.y - ship_radius < wall_bottom):
    # Determine collision side and reverse appropriate velocity component
    # Apply energy loss (0.8 multiplier)
    # Push ship away from wall
```

## Testing
Run the game and complete the first challenge by moving the piece to the slot. You should experience:
1. Triumph sound when puzzle completes
2. 3-second pause
3. Automatic transition to second challenge
4. Wall obstacle blocking direct path
5. Forklift bouncing off wall when collision occurs

The implementation provides a smooth progression from basic gameplay to more complex navigation challenges while maintaining the core puzzle mechanics.
